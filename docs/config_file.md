# Customize the configuration file 
Not all fields are used for all models, they must be filled but will be ignored during training. 
For example, the type of hidden layers can only be customised for the CGAN model.

```
[MODEL_TYPE]
model = id of the model [1: CGAN, 2: AED, 3: ED]
w_gan = if wasserstein GAN

evaluation_path = path to save results of evaluation
model_path = automatically created during training, use during evaluation and/or generation
